# House-Price-Prediction
The main objective for this project is to use various machine learning techniques to determine the Price of a House based on various factors like number of rooms, location of house ,etc. Here, I used the 4 Most common machine learing alogrithms for regression:

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. Support Vector Regressor

In the end, I also compare the the accuracy of these models to discern which one is the most accurate.
